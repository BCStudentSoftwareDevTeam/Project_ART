# Ullman Galleries 
Ullman Galleries is a management tool for application entries. It provides an easy way to accept applications. Our main purpose for the system is to accept applications from artists that want to show their work in a Berea College Gallery Showing.
  

## Getting Started
The intial step of setting up a development environment is choosing the appropriate tool to complete the application setup.
This application requires you to have a linux environment specifically an Ubuntu.
However, if you are working out of a windows operating system during development we would recommend you use [cloud9](https://c9.io/)

### Cloud9 Setup Guide (Optional)
You can find the instruction to setting up c9 at https://docs.c9.io/docs/create-a-workspace. You should use python as the template.

### Starting up the Application

After you have accessed your environment, we have built some scripts into the system that will get the application up and running for you. 

1. ```python setup.py install```
2. ```. venv/bin/activate```
3. ``` mysql-ctl install ```
3. ``` python scripts/ConfigureApp.py ``` - Use the creditails outputted by mysql-ctl
4. ```python app.py```s

>***Note***: If you working inside of your own linux environment you may need to change the port and host information inside of ```app.py`` the default is setup up for working inside of cloud9
>***Note***: You may also need to setup mysql on your own.
>***Note***: To start and stop mysql use ```mysql.server [start|stop|restart]```
